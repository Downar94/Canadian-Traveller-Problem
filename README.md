# Canadian-Traveller-Problem
The algorithms in Python for resolving Canadian Traveller Problem (CTP). CTP is a problem where the main goal is to find the shortest path between 2 nodes under uncertain conditions. The edges between nodes (roads) may be blocked, with a given probability. For this purpose 3 types of algorithms have been created:
- Optimism (OMT)
- Hindsight Optimization (HOP)
- Optimistic UCT (UCTO)
